# AI-Powered-Intelligent-Insurance-Risk-Assessment-and-Customer-Insights-System
📌 Project Overview

Insurance companies face significant challenges in risk assessment, claim prediction, fraud detection, and customer experience management. Traditional manual processes are slow, biased, and inefficient when handling large-scale insurance data.

This project builds a comprehensive AI-powered insurance analytics system using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP to automate and optimize core insurance operations such as:

Risk classification & claim amount prediction

Fraud detection using anomaly detection

Customer segmentation using clustering

Sentiment analysis of customer feedback

Multilingual insurance document translation

Policy summarization & automated chatbot responses

🎯 Objectives

Risk Classification & Claim Prediction

Predict high-risk vs low-risk insurance claims

Estimate expected claim amounts using regression models

Customer Segmentation

Cluster customers into meaningful groups for personalized policies

Fraud Detection

Detect fraudulent claims using anomaly detection and association rules

Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction

Apply PCA, t-SNE, and Autoencoders for better performance

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Sentiment analysis of customer feedback

Multilingual document translation

Policy document summarization

Automated chatbot responses using transformers

🏢 Business Use Cases
