# 🧠 AI-Powered Intelligent Insurance Risk Assessment & Customer Insights System

## 📌 Project Overview

Insurance companies face significant challenges in **risk assessment, claim prediction, fraud detection, and customer experience management**. Traditional manual processes are slow, biased, and inefficient when handling large-scale insurance data.

This project implements a **comprehensive AI-powered insurance analytics system** using **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automate and optimize core insurance operations.

## 🎯 Objectives

* **Risk Classification & Claim Prediction**

  * Classify insurance claims as high-risk or low-risk
  * Predict expected claim amounts using regression models

* **Customer Segmentation**

  * Cluster customers into meaningful segments for personalized insurance plans

* **Fraud Detection**

  * Identify fraudulent claims using anomaly detection and association rule mining

* **Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction**

  * Improve model performance using PCA, t-SNE, and Autoencoders

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

  * Sentiment analysis of customer feedback
  * Multilingual insurance document translation
  * Policy document summarization
  * Automated chatbot responses using transformer models
